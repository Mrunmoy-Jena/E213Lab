      abstract     = {A measurement of the Drell-Yan differential cross section
                      in proton-proton collisionsat a centre-of-mass energy of 7
                      TeV is presented. The results are obtained using
                      Z$^0$/$\gamma$ $r\rightarrow$ $\mu^+$$\mu^-$ decays in a
                      data sample collected with the CMS detector correspondingto
                      an integrated luminosity of 4.9 fb$^{-1}$. The cross section
                      of Drell-Yanproduction in association with one or two jets
                      with pjetT > 30 GeV in the range ofjjetj < 4.5 is measured.
                      The differential cross section is studied as a function
                      ofthe dimuon transverse momentum pT and of the invariant
                      mass, covering a rangeof 30 < m$^{\mu}$$^{\mu}$ < 1500 GeV.
                      In addition, the Drell-Yan dimuon pair is selected inthe
                      forward region with $\eta$ $^{\mu}$ $^{\mu}$> 2.5 and the
                      differential cross section as well as theaverage jet
                      multiplicity, as a function of the rapidity separation
                      between the leadingjet and the Drell-Yan lepton pair, is
                      presented. All measurements are compared topredictions of
                      fixed-order perturbative QCD plus parton showers, provided
                      by MonteCarlo simulation. An agreement of the distributions
                      with predictions of resummedQCD combined with high
                      fixed-order perturbative QCD is observed.
                      Lowest-ordercalculations of the cross section are not able
                      to describe the Drell-Yan + jets crosssection at low pT and
                      large rapidity differences. The Drell-Yan plus jet
                      topologiesare sensitive to hard-parton emissions calculated
                      at fixed-order in perturbationtheory plus resummation of
                      multi-gluon emissions.},
